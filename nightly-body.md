## Installation and quick usage

Extract the UEVR.zip to a folder of your choice, then:

1. Launch the frontend GUI (UEVRInjector.exe)
2. Launch the target game
3. Locate the game in the process dropdown list
4. Select your desired runtime (OpenVR/OpenXR)
5. Toggle existing VR plugin nullification (if necessary)
6. Configure pre-injection settings
7. Inject

More information and troubleshooting can be found on the [Documentation](https://praydog.github.io/uevr-docs/) page.

## Additional notes

You may need to whitelist the UEVR folder or executable within your antivirus software for the time being.

If nothing happens, try moving UEVR to a different folder.
